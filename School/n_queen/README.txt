This folder contains programs relating to the n-queen problem.
As I am most familiar with C++ at this time, all the programs here are written
in C++.


loop.cc     - Conventional way / fastest way I know of to check n-queen problem.
additon.cc  - A way I found to check a n-queen solution that I think is cool.
